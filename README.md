# bookapi
Book API demonstrates the RESTful web services using Spring MVC. Book API performs all the CRUD operations. User can create a book, read a single book, update a book and delete a book. To communicate with database we will use Hibernate which is our ORM framework and MySQL is the database to store the records.
